## Hi there 👋

### 🚀About Me
🎓 I decided to change direction and find my place in the IT-sphere. I'm a hardworking and flexible person who is open to change. I believe I’m a fast learner and a good team player. I guess a combination of these qualities and skills will make me a good fit.

   I'm currently **looking for a job!**

<!-- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js. -->
